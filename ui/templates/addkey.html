            <p>You will need an ssh key pair to authenticate to some devices. You have to save the public key here.
                Otherwise you will not be able to do reservations for some environments.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Please note, that gafaspot will fetch your key at the moment your reservation starts. So if you change
                your key while your reservation is active, this will have no effect to the reservation. Also make sure
                to keep your private key somewhere, because gafaspot doesn't save it and will not be able to tell you.
